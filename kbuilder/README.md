# Welcome to the KISS Query Builder

This is the Keep It Stupid Simple query builder created to work
either in conjunction or separated from the ksql package.

## TODO List

- Support Insert and Update operations
- Improve support to JOINs by adding the `tablename` tag to the structs
- Add error check for when the Select, Insert and Update attrs are all empty
